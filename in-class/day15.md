## Camera Calibration Resources

If you are running your computer vision project on the simulator, you should not need to do camera calibration; as Gazebo does not inject distortion into the image. However if you for some reason wanted to do this, here are a few resources:

* <a-no-proxy href="http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=camera_distortion&cat=sensors"> Gazebo article on creating distortion </a-no-proxy>
* A <a-no-proxy href="https://github.com/oKermorgant/calibration_gazebo"> github repo </a-no-proxy> for camera calibration in Gazebo (note that we haven't had a chance to try this yet. No guarantees.)


If you want to work with real Neatos in the future, or want to calibrate a different camera (e.g. your webcam) here is the <a-no-proxy href="http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration"> ROS documentation on camera calibration. </a-no-proxy> Note that you'll need a checkerboard.
