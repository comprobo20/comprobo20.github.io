## Today

* Bayesian filtering and the particle filter

## For Next Time

* Work on the <a-no-proxy href="https://olin.instructure.com/courses/143/assignments/1325">Robot Localization project</a-no-proxy>. For the next class you should have done the part of the "Implementation Plan" part of the assignment.
* Make sure to check out the <a-no-proxy href="https://olin.instructure.com/courses/143/assignments/1314"> Discussion Assignment </a-no-proxy> for your teams and presentation times. 
* Read <a-no-proxy href="https://robohub.org/the-legal-issues-of-robotics/"> this summary on legal issues in robotics </a-no-proxy>, <a-no-proxy href="https://www.therobotreport.com/liability-robot-legal-debate/"> this article on liability </a-no-proxy>, and this <a-no-proxy href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHyUYg8X31c" > quick video </a-no-proxy> to prepare for Monday's discussion. 

## Bayesian Filtering and the Particle Filter

* [Notes from Today on Bayes' filter](bayes_filter.pdf)
* Notes from Previous Years on Bayes' filter and how it applies to robot localization are <a-no-proxy href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sKAjnXwNeYJG45RLjHPRsiTbP8TuF7A/view">here</a-no-proxy>.

### Proposed Model for Working through this Derivation
With your partner and another team, work through the notes on a chalkboard.  Here are some guidelines.

* Make sure everyone understands each step before moving onto the next one.
* If there is a persistent issue that cannot be resolved, call a member of the teaching team over and ask us for help.  If for some reason this is not easy to do at the time, make a note of it so you can return to it later.
* If you need more help at any point in the derivation, don't hesitate to call a member of the teaching team over and ask for help.
* Stop when you get to the section labeled "Scalability."


## The Particle Filter Algorithm (together as a class)
As a class, let's go through the basic steps of the particle filter algorithm and the issues around scalability of the Bayes filter.
