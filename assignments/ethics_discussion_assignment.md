## Assignment Details

This is a pretty open ended assignment - we want to spend time thinking about relevant social/robotics issues and discussing them as a group. We're hoping this leads to more interesting conversations and help us work towards making robots that make the world a better place.

We'd like you to come up with the lesson plan. It should be 15-20 minutes long and could look something like the <a-no-proxy href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19vvms_58HVD-8TtENqQD7XjgfM93wyVk2WlSxExM-Ww/edit?usp=sharing> the discussion we had on robots and liability</a-no-proxy> (except don't be like Melinda and forget to share the slides!) E.g. choose an article or video for the class to read ahead of time and come up with some discussion questions or an activity for the class. 

Your lesson plan is due by midnight on the night before the class before your presentation (e.g. if you're Oct. 5th, please have it to us by the morning of the 28th). 

## Team and Topic Assignments

Dates were assigned randomly by picking numbers out of a hat. If you want to trade with another team and they are amenable - that's fine, just let us know!
