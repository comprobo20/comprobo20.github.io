In addition to simulators, we'll be making heavy use of datasets in this class. In contrast to simulators, datasets will typically involve recordings of sensor data and motor commands from real robots.  As such, datasets will be great for testing out perception algorithms (e.g., robot localization, computer vision), but not so good for testing out control algorithms (since we can't command our robot to do anything different than it did when the dataset was recorded).
